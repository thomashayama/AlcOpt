It glides across the tongue without astringency or harshness, often with a round and supple mouthfeel. Smooth wines are typically aged longer, allowing tannins to mellow, or they naturally have lower tannin levels. Examples include Merlot, Pinot Noir, and aged Bordeaux blends.
        A tannic wine, on the other hand, has a firm, grippy structure due to higher levels of tannins‚Äîcompounds found in grape skins, seeds, and oak aging. Tannins create a drying sensation in the mouth, similar to strong black tea. These wines can feel bold and structured, often benefiting from aging to soften their texture over time. Examples include young Cabernet Sauvignon, Nebbiolo, and Syrah.""")

These wines do not taste sweet but may still have fruit-forward flavors. Dry wines can range from crisp and refreshing (like Sauvignon Blanc) to bold and tannic (like Cabernet Sauvignon).
        A sweet wine retains some of its natural sugars, giving it a noticeable sweetness on the palate. Sweet wines can range from lightly off-dry (like Riesling) to lusciously rich and dessert-like (such as Sauternes or Port). The sweetness can be balanced by acidity to keep the wine lively rather than cloying.""")

Examples include Merlot, Viognier, and oaked Chardonnay.
        An acidic wine has a bright, crisp, and zesty character due to higher acidity. Acidity gives wine a lively, refreshing quality and enhances its ability to pair with food. It can create a tingling sensation on the tongue and make the mouth water. High-acid wines, like Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, and Pinot Noir, tend to taste more vibrant and structured.""")

It is typically fruit-forward and easy to drink, with a clean and consistent profile. Simple wines can still be enjoyable and refreshing, often making them great for casual drinking. Examples include young Pinot Grigio, Beaujolais Nouveau, and some unoaked Chardonnays.
        A complex wine, on the other hand, offers multiple layers of flavors and aromas that evolve over time in the glass. It may have a mix of fruit, spice, earth, floral, and oak characteristics that change as you sip, revealing new nuances. Complex wines often have longer finishes and develop more character as they age. Examples include aged Bordeaux, Burgundy, and fine Barolo.""")
